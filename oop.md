Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming
object-oriented programming allows 
* to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time;
* hide the implementation from the end-user.




* class : a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes

* objects : object - an instance of a class

* attribute - a **descriptor** or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.

* method - an **action** that a class or object could take


* encapsulation - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called encapsulation: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a class. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms.
