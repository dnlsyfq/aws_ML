# Supervised

* Teaches model providing dataset with example inputs and outputs
* tell the model which o/p are correct
* input -> model -> output/prediction


# Unsupervised

* No external teacher or pre-trained data
* model detects emerging properties in the input dataset
* model then constructs patterns or clusters



# Deep Learning

* Time series / predictive analysis
  * log analysis
  * risk fraud detection
  * predictive anaysis sensor data 

* image analysis
  * image recognition




# Machine Learning : Multiple Linear Regression

Good models require multiple regressions, in order to address the higher complexity of problems

* yhat = inferred value 
* b0 = intercept 
* b1x1 , b2x2 , bkxk = independent variable
